# 📖 Manual:

1. Initialising nspm:

- By default, nspm creates a `.nspm` folder in the `$HOME` directory to hold all databases (except those passed as an argument).

- If no databases are found, nspm will prompt you to pass the `-n` argument to initialize a new database.

2. There are two different ways to select a database in nspm:
   - Run nspm with the `-f` flag and pass a database path as an argument.
   - Select a database from the menu that will be shown if nspm finds any databases in `$HOME/.nspm`.
